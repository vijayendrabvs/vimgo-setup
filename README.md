Thanks to DJ (Dhananjay Sampath) for providing the base vimrc file!
          ----------------------


INSTRUCTIONS:
============

This has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, but should work for any
generic Ubuntu release.

NOTE - Run this only on a fresh Ubuntu server/VM/container. If
you already have go installed on the server, this will probably
break it.

To install all the go plugins for vim, simply do this:

# git clone  https://github.com/vijayendrabvs/vimgo-setup.git
# cd vimgo-setup/ubuntu/
# ./setup-vim-go.sh
